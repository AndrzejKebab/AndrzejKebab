## ðŸ’« About me
I'm an aspiring **Junior Unity Developer** focused on building prototypes and technical demos in Unity (C#). I enjoy solving performance problems, designing runtime systems and experimenting with procedural generation.  
Most of my experience comes from personal projects, game jams and collaborative prototypes â€” all public on my GitHub.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Current focus
- Finish and ship playable game.  
- Improving my experience with multithreaded systems in Unity (Jobs/Burst).  
- Build modular, reusable tools that speed up prototyping.
